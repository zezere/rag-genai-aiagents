# Exercises for Diogo's course on RAG, AI Agents and Generative AI with Python and OpenAI 2025

This repository contains my implementations of exercises and code examples from Diogo’s course on RAG, AI Agents, and Generative AI. The course materials were originally provided as Jupyter Notebook files, but I have restructured and replicated the code in a traditional Python project format. This structure is ideal for those who prefer working with Python scripts instead of Notebooks.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the Python scripts for the exercises. Each script is well-documented with comments to guide you through the code and its functionality.
- **`data/`**: Includes pre-downloaded datasets required for the exercises. If you wish to download fresh copies or learn how to fetch the data programmatically, the relevant code is included in the scripts but commented out.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zezere/rag-genai-aiagents.git
2. **Explore the code**:
   Navigate to the **`src/`** folder, where you’ll find Python scripts - for now one script for exercises in Section 3 of the course, and another script for Section 5.
3. **Run the code**:
   ```bash
   python src/basics_of_retrieval_systems.py
   python src/basics_of_generation_models.py
